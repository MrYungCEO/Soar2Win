### Key Positioning Changes ✅ IMPLEMENTED:
- [✅] You're no longer a "general leadership coach."
- [✅] You're THE expert for successful women who struggle with self-doubt.
- [✅] P.O.W.E.R. framework + Positive Intelligence = your unique methodology.
- [✅] Premium pricing ($8,500) positions you as high-level transformation expert.

### NOTES DISCOVERED DURING WORK:
- The "Power of Coaching" and "Why Work with a Certified Coach" sections were not found in the current `index.html` - they may have been previously removed or renamed.
- Hero image was not found - the current hero section uses strong copy-focused design without image.
- The `unmute-your-power-program.html` file already existed with good content and just needed the final "Ready to Lead" closing section.
- Navigation appears to already be properly structured.
- Contact form dropdown was already focused on relevant programs.

### REMAINING TASKS (if any):
- [ ] Review navigation structure across all pages to ensure consistency (may be already complete).
- [ ] Consider adding more detailed program information to the Unmute Your Power page if needed.
